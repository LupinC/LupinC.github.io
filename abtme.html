        <p class="text-special">Besides running, I love bank fishing and cars. I used to have a 1970 Chevy Impala, but I had to sell the car because I have no time.</p>

        <p class="text">The Impala and Me.<br></p>
        <p class="text-special">I have to fix the car myself when it breaks down because no shops will take it and fix it in a short amount of time. 
            And so I have to change the oil, etc all by myself. The following pictures are the several times when it breaks down. And I successfully fixed the car without a garage.
