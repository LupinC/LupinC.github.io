    <h1>{ Design_questions }</h1>
    <p class="question">How did the design process impact the decisions you made?<br></p> 
    <p class="text-special">Since there are 5 stage of desgin thinking, each of them impact the decision I made seperately.<br></p> 
    <p class="text-special">For the part of "Emphasize", in my opinion, it is the hardest part because when designing a project, 
      it is very difficult to understand what the user would need if we do not have interviews. I encountered this issue 
      when trying to create a game for people with aphantasia who cannot come to visual imaginary. As a result, we have to 
      condsidered related research paper to find out how different the user needs from what I can produce to determine what 
      technology I want to start with for the decision of choosing the right tool. <br></p>
    <p class="text-special">For the part of "Define", we have gathered information for the needs of the user. However, I have to take in the 
      account for the potential problems that is correlated with the needs from the user. For example, when designing the game for users 
      with aphantasia using Unreal Engine 5, the user wants potential player-interactions. However, how to create suitable interactions within 
      the scene that is dazzling is hard. As a result, I have to change decision of game play from FPS, which was originally designed to
      puzzle-solving. The picture below is a blueprint class for user in the puzzle game in where you see that I directly took it from the blueprint
      for first-person-shooting but implemented the inventory system of this class. <br>
    </p>
    <img src="pictures/indexs/sea1.jpg" alt="Description of Image 1"class="special-image">
    <p class="text-special">
      For the part of "ideate", it requires me to start with take want I have learned from the previous section 
      into the design. I have to layout every possible combination of what I would expect and what to modify with brainstorming.
      For example, in the project of transforming the nuclear explosion data visualization into real life object. The first few 
      brainstorming results was to make explosion in real life, which is difficult and dangerous. Therefore, the decision for 
      utilizing fireworks for displaying the effect of nuclear explosion in real life had to change from kinematic to static.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="text-special">
      For the part of "prototypes", it seldom impacts my decisions as the main issue for this part is how well I am in programing.
      And when I encountered coding issues, I usually try several ways of my own thinking, which are most likely to fail. Then I looked for 
      help and learn from either youtube or GPT4. If I still cannot find the solution, I will go to an expert for help.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="text-special">
      For the part of "testing", it impacts my decision the most because it is determines whether I "Emphasize" or "Define" correctly 
      for the potential user. One example from a successful project was the user testing for the nulcear explosion data visiualization
      website as all the feedback from the viewer is awe and educated, which is the effect we intended the website to have.<br></p>
    <p class="question">What were the most valuable pieces? <br></p>
    <p class="text-special">
      In my opinion, the most valuable pieces I have are the bookbot project and the puzzle-solving game. For bookbot, it taught me how 
      to work as a team for the first time. And while implementing it, I learned a lot about network framework and javascript alongside 
      with AWS EC2 instance. For the puzzle-solving, I learned a lot about CPP when debugging the "blueprint coding" and the unreal engine,
      which amazed me on the capabilities it provides. From above cases, I absorb the design to be simplist and minimalistic in a way that both 
      projects are intuitive enough for user to operate without detailed guidance.<br></p> 
    <p class="question">Were there limitations to the design process that you encountered?<br></p>
    <p class="text-special">
      The limitations for most of the project presented in the portfolio section are time and skills. I do not have time to refine most of them, 
      and I do not have enough skills to improve them. As a result, I am actively learning more about website developemenet and game developemenet
      specifically game developemenet to create a world that I want to stay in.<br></p> 
    <p class="question">How did this differ across different modalities? For example, maybe user testing with your prototypes was more illuminating in one modality 
      than another. Maybe the true capabilities of the technology constrained you more in one modality than another.<br></p> 
    <p class="text-special">The modality varies for different designs that is correlated to specific content or data. For example, for the website for nuclear explosion data 
      visualization, since there are not many similar datagraph or website for them, as long as the design is presenting a extremely large power ratio in this case of one bomb 
      to another bomb, it will be eye-catching, ie, the modality is more illuminating than both the bookbot project and the dream puzzle game, even though it took 40 hours from 
      me to implement the dream puzzle game with a bagpack system, and it only took me 4 hours to implement the interactive graphs.<br></p>
    <p class="question">When did expectations not meet reality?<br></p> 
    <p class="text-special">Such event happened a lot, for the bookbot project, the school did not give any funds for deployment, as a result, when I was first deploying
      with llama2 on EC2's free tier with 1 GB of ram to have bookbot running own its own, the website is extremely slow. And the solution was to 
      plug it with Davinci Model from Open AI. For the puzzle game, it was intended to be with 4 levels. Due to time constrained, it was fininshed with only 2 levels 
      done and one level polished. And for the 2d game engine, it could only be used to design one level due to my limited skills.<br></p>
    <p class="question">Were there some topic areas that were more challenging than others? <br></p> 
    <p class="text-special">Some topic areas that were more challenging than others are definitely the topics on 3D visualization and 3D game implementation because 
      they not only requires technical skills but also heavy imagination: to have a unique scenary that can catch the viewer or the reader or the user's attention 
      as they navigate from scenes to scenes in my project. And it is hard to have something worthy for the user to memorize as there are so many designs that 
      they have already seen. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="question">What did you learn from this process?</p>
    <p class="text-special">From this process, I learned that interviews and user testings are the most important part of the design process because I am not making a 
      product for my own but rather a product for those that needed the product. And it is very difficult to substitute myself into their stands 
      so the only tool possible to let me know what the user want and whether I design it correctly will be interviews and user testings.<br></p>

  <section id="design_manifesto">
    <h1>{ Design_manifesto }</h1>
    <p><br></p>
    <p class="text-specialt">As for my design manifesto, I want my project to be as simple but yet eye-catching enough.<br></p>
    <p class="questiont">  For the "Emphasize" stage, it should be: <br></p>
    <p class="text-specialt">
      1. The result from interviews.<br>
      2. The feedback from similar existing products<br>
      3. The suggestion from similar developemenet.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="questiont">  For the "Define" stage, it should be: <br></p>
    <p class="text-special">
      1. The collection of pros from previous stage, for example, the nuclear mobil.<br>
      2. Reasonable from the view of those who need this product, for example the dream puzzle game.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="questiont">  For the "Ideate" stage, it should be: <br></p>
    <p class="text-special">
      1. A set of multiple workable solutions in case one does not work, for example the redesign of QMED.<br>
      2. As simple and minimalistic as possible for user to be able to be operate without guidance, for example the nuclear explosion data visiualization<br>
      3. As bold as possible for some specific designs like games.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="questiont">  For the "Prototype" stage, it should be: <br></p>
    <p class="text-special">
      1. Easily accessible for user testing, for example, the 2D game engine.<br>
      2. Replicable such that your collegue might be able to spot bugs for your implementation.<br>
      3. Actively reiterable as the next iteration or generation can come up quickly for after the next stage of testing.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="questiont">  For the "Testing" stage, it should be: <br></p>
    <p class="text-special">
      1. Done rapidly for reliablity.<br>
      2. Done with multiple user testings for feedback to go back to Emphasize and start the cycle again quickly.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="questiont">However, all of this are my own take from the design and implementation of the projects that I have done so far, please give me your advice!</p>
