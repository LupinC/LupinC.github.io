    <p>How did the design process impact the decisions you made?<br></p> 
    <p>What were the most valuable pieces? <br></p> 
    <p>Were there limitations to the design process that you encountered?<br></p> 
    <p>How did this differ across different modalities? For example, maybe user testing with your prototypes was more illuminating in one modality than another. Maybe the true capabilities of the technology constrained you more in one modality than another.<br></p> 
    <p>When did expectations not meet reality?<br></p> 
    <p>Were there some topic areas that were more challenging than others? <br></p> 
    <p>What did you learn from this process?</p>
